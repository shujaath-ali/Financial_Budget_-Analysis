# Financial_Budget_Analysis
Financial budget analysis using Python involves the use of various libraries and techniques to analyze financial data and create budget forecasts. Here we will be analyzing the Indian National Budget of the financial year 2021. We would analyze the data with respect to each department, process it and Visualize the same in the form of a Pie Chart. Such Visualization helps companies and organizations to understand the National Budget and interpret the future investments of their companies. The important Python libraries that were used are Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib. So, you have to install these libraries and the Dataset to run the code successfully (Note:- Ensure that you give proper address of the dataset from your local machine in the code.)
Happy Coding!
